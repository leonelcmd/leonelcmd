### Hello guys - ciao a tutti - olÃ¡ pessoal, I'm Leonel ðŸ¤Ÿ

I'm a Javascript student and test automator with Cypress but this is me now, before that I worked as barist (yes I know how to latteart). 
</br>What a programmer and a barist have in common? Obviously the dark necessity for coffee â˜•.
</br>You can expect a more relevant content here but for now that is all, thanks for visiting my profile ðŸ™‚
